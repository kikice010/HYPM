#####P-IDM:

 + contact us on location page
 + each tool in equipment page is separate page but grouped in one page
+ list all types of contract and all number of visits, just to be selectable, in Fees and registration page
+ instructor of the month is a single page merged in our implementation with other instructor pages in a single page.
+ each instructor should be presented on a separate page, at least in p idm.
+ clicking on category yoga shows that category and a brief description of category. and there are structural links to level and alphabetical order.. once category is shown there are also transitional links that lead to courses that b elong to that category.
+ category, level and alphabetical ordering of courses are separate pages in p idm.
+ on a specific course page there must be shown from where we came (category yoga, level basic). and next to the name of course we should place its level.
+ each room is a single page in our schema
