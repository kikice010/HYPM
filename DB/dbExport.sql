(10, 'Cardio', 'Cardio (also known as aerobic exercise) is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. Aerobic literally means relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. Generally, light-to-moderate intensity activities that are sufficiently supported by aerobic metabolism can be performed for extended periods of time.', 'Many people credit Dr Kenneth H. Cooper for the invention of the cardio class in the 1960s, Cooper was a former air force Colonel who advocated the importance of cardiovascular fitness as well as strength training. Although his book Aerobics brought the importance of aerobic exercise into the spotlight, the origins of the aerobic exercise class can actually be traced back to schools in the turn of the 19th to 20th Century Britain where the physical state of soldiers had been an embarrassment during the Boer War and thus lead to physical education being enforced into schools.', 'Increases the efficiency of respiration.

(11, 'Dance', 'Dance is the art of movement of the body, usually rhythmically and to music, using prescribed or improvised steps and gestures. A dance is any one prescribed sequence of such movements, or the music to which it is performed, or an event at which it takes place. Dance may also be regarded as a form of nonverbal communication recognisable in other animals; in bee dances and behaviour patterns such as mating dances.\n\nDance can be categorized and described in various ways. It may be analysed purely by its choreography, its repertoire of movements, or it may be classified according to its time or place of origin. Yet study reveals many generic similarities in many different times and places.', 'Archeological evidence for early dance includes 9,000 year old paintings in India at the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.\n\nBefore the invention of written languages, dance was a more important method of passing stories down from generation to generation. The use of dance in ecstatic trance states and healing rituals, as today in many cultures from the Brazilian rainforest to the Kalahari Desert, is thought to have been another early factor.\n\nGreek dance (horos) is referred to by Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch and Lucian.\n\nThe Bible and Talmud refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms.\n\nIn Chinese pottery as early as the Neolithic period groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands. The earliest Chinese word for dance is found written in the oracle bones. Dance is described in the Lüshi Chunqiu. Primitive dance in ancient China was associated with sorcery and shamanic rituals.\n\nDuring the first millennium BCE in India, many texts were composed which attempted to codify aspects of daily life. Bharata Munis Natyashastra (literally the text of dramaturgy) is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorises dance into four types - secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive - and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (mudras) and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. From these beginnings rose the various classical styles recognised today.\n\nMany contemporary dance forms can be traced back to historical, traditional, ceremonial, and ethnic dance.', 'There are numerous benefits to partaking in dance classes ranging from increasing your amount of daily exercise to making new friends with shared interests. In the European Union the weekly exercise targets for children are currently set at a minimum of 1 hour per day for children and at least 30 minutes, five times a week, for adults. Although these targets may look daunting at first, they can easily be met by attending dance classes. Some of the benefits to increasing the amount of exercise you do are; reduced stress levels, improved relaxation, stronger bones and muscles and help to control body weight.', 'Anyone'),
(12, 'Martial Arts', 'Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a variety of reasons: self-defense, competition, physical health and fitness, entertainment, as well as mental, physical, and spiritual development.\n\nAlthough the term martial art has become associated with the fighting arts of eastern Asia, it originally referred to the combat systems of Europe as early as the 1550s. The term is derived from Latin, and means arts of Mars, the Roman god of war. Some authors have argued that fighting arts or fighting systems would be more appropriate on the basis that many martial arts were never martial in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors', 'Although the earliest evidence of martial arts goes back millennia, the true roots are difficult to reconstruct. Inherent patterns of human aggression which inspire practice of mock combat (in particular wrestling) and optimization of serious close combat as cultural universals are doubtlessly inherited from the pre-human stage, and were made into an art from the earliest emergence of that concept. Indeed, many universals of martial art are fixed by the specifics of human physiology and not dependent on a specific tradition or era.\n\nSpecific martial traditions become identifiable in Classical Antiquity, with disciplines such as shuai jiao, Greek wrestling or those described in the Indian epics or the Spring and Autumn Annals of China.', 'Many of the physical benefits of training resemble those achieved by any other form of exercise. A normal training session of taekwondo or Hapkido involves a period of warming up, stretching, then training. The exercise one gets from martial arts training improves balance, flexibility, stamina, and posture. Weight loss is promoted through extended cardiovascular activity. These are all results of long term martial arts training and can, for the most part, be achieved by doing any type of sport or exercise regimen for an extended period of time. These physical changes are easily noticed and often sought after so much that the more subtle health benefits are overlooked.', 'Anyone'),
(13, 'Pilates', 'PilatesGerman: is a physical fitness system developed in the early 20th century by the Greek German-born Joseph Pilates. It is \nespecially practiced in the United States (where Pilates lived, developed and taught his method) and the United Kingdom (where he lived and taught early stages of his method). As of 2005, there were 11 million people practicing the discipline regularly and 14,000 instructors in the United States.', 'Pilates was designed by Joseph Pilates, a physical-culturist from Mönchengladbach, Germany. His father was a prize-winning gymnast from Greece and his mother a naturopath. He studied both Eastern and Western forms of exercise including yoga.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, he developed a system of exercises which were intended to strengthen the human mind and body. Pilates believed that mental and physical health were interrelated.\n\nIn his youth he had practiced many of the physical training regimes available in Germany, and it was from these he developed his own work. It has clear connections with the physical culture of the late nineteenth century, such as the use of special apparatuses and claims that the exercises could cure ill health. It is also related to the tradition of corrective exercise or medical gymnastics as typified by Pehr Henrik Ling. Joseph Pilates, like many, was trapped in Britain because of war. On the Isle of Man, he started teaching other trapped Germans about pilates.', '#1 Pilates Benefit: It strengthens your core.\nPilates is very focused on your center so strong abdominals are a given, Siler says. Every movement emanates from what we call your powerhouse, which houses your abs, glutes, and inner thighs.\n\n#2 Pilates Benefit: It improves your flexibility.\nA study published in the Asian Journal of Sports Medicine found that people who did Pilates-based training for 45-minute sessions twice a week saw an increase in their flexibility and lumbo-pelvic stability. Joe Pilates said you are as young as your spine is flexible and with his method we create youth and wellbeing through a supple and articulated spine, says Siler. This is particularly useful when trying to counteract the modern day convenience of sitting down at your computer for the day and never needing to get up again.\n\n#3 Pilates Benefit: It helps you sleep.\nIts no secret that hitting the gym can help you snooze, but a new study published in the Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies found that Pilates is particularly effective when it comes to bed time. The research showed that it can improve sleep patterns, reduce daytime sleepiness, and lessen broken sleep cycles.', 'Anyone'),
(14, 'Yoga', 'Yoga  is an Indian physical, mental, and spiritual practice or discipline. There is a broad variety of schools, practices and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism (including Vajrayana and Tibetan Buddhism) and Jainism. The best-known are Hatha yoga and Raja yoga.', 'The origins of Yoga have been speculated to date back to preVedic Indian traditions, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient Indias ascetic circles, which are also credited with the early sramana movements.The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads and Buddhist Pali Canon, probably of third century BCE or later. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali from first half of 1st millennium CE is one of a key surviving major texts on Yoga. Hatha yoga texts emerged around 11th century CE, and in its origins was related to Tantrism.\n\nYoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the west, following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a system of physical exercise across the Western world. Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise, it has a meditative and spiritual core. One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called Yoga, which has its own epistemology and metaphysics, and is closely related to Hindu Samkhya philosophy.', 'Increases the efficiency of respiration.

(15, 'Circuit Traning', 'Circuit training is a form of body conditioning or resistance training using high-intensity aerobics. It targets strength building and muscular endurance. An exercise circuit is one completion of all prescribed exercises in the program. When one circuit is complete, one begins the first exercise again for the next circuit. Traditionally, the time between exercises in circuit training is short, often with rapid movement to the next exercise.\n\nThe program was developed by R.E. Morgan and G.T. Anderson in 1957 at the University of Leeds in England.', 'Circuit training is an enduring and evolving training exercise format that was developed by R.E. Morgan and G.T. Anderson in 1953 at the University of Leeds in England (Kravitz 1996). The term circuit refers to a number of carefully selected exercises arranged consecutively. In the original format, 9–12 stations comprised the circuit; this number may vary according to the circuit’s design. Each circuit training participant moves from one station to the next with little (15–30 seconds) or no rest, performing a 15- to 45-second work bout of 8–20 repetitions at each station (using a resistance of about 40%–60% of one-repetition maximum [1RM]). The circuit training workout program may be performed with exercise machines, hand-held weights, elastic resistance, calisthenics or any combination of these. ', 'Circuit training stations are generally sequenced in a way to alternate between muscle groups, which allows for adequate recovery. The rest interval between stations should be between 30-90 seconds and 1-3 minutes between circuits. A typical gym has several strength training machines and workstations, which enables the creation of several circuits. This benefit of variability challenges the skills of the participant and keeps them interested from session to session.\n\nCircuit training plays an integral role in the offseason workouts of many professional athletes. It serves as a way to maintain general fitness while avoiding the high physical demands of in-season sport. Circuit training also serves as a segue to higher level strengthening programs in these athletes.', 'Anyone'),
(16, 'Strenght', 'Strength training is a type of physical exercise specializing in the use of resistance to induce muscular contraction which builds the strength, anaerobic endurance, and size of skeletal muscles.\n\nWhen properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased bone, muscle, tendon and ligament strength and toughness, improved joint function, reduced potential for injury, increased bone density, increased metabolism, increased fitness, improved cardiac function, and improved lipoprotein lipid profiles, including elevated HDL (good) cholesterol. Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity, although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of aerobic exercise through circuit training.', 'Until the 20th century, the history of strength training was very similar to the history of weight training. With the advent of modern technology, materials and knowledge, the methods that can be used for strength training have multiplied significantly.\n\nHippocrates explained the principle behind strength training when he wrote that which is used develops, and that which is not used wastes away, referring to muscular hypertrophy and atrophy. Progressive resistance training dates back at least to Ancient Greece, when legend has it that wrestler Milo of Croton trained by carrying a newborn calf on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician Galen, described strength training exercises using the halteres (an early form of dumbbell) in the 2nd century. Ancient Persians used the meels, which became popular during the 19th century as the Indian club, and has recently made a comeback in the form of the clubbell.', 'Increases the efficiency of respiration.

(17, 'Flexibility', 'Stretching is a form of physical exercise in which a specific muscle or tendon (or muscle group) is deliberately flexed or stretched in order to improve the muscles felt elasticity and achieve comfortable muscle tone. The result is a feeling of increased muscle control, flexibility, and range of motion. Stretching is also used therapeutically to alleviate cramps.\n\nIn its most basic form, stretching is a natural and instinctive activity; it is performed by humans and many other animals. It can be accompanied by yawning. Stretching often occurs instinctively after waking from sleep, after long periods of inactivity, or after exiting confined spaces and areas.\n\nIncreasing flexibility through stretching is one of the basic tenets of physical fitness. It is common for athletes to stretch before and after exercise in order to reduce injury and increase performance', 'In sports history coaches and practitioners use stretching as the universal strategy for injury prevention, dating back to literature from the 1980’s. In the current day and age one must only turn on the television to see various trainers and team doctors training athletes, before the game, on the sidelines and after the game.  The question is, has all this stretching actually done anything in the pursuit of increasing performance or decreasing injury risk?  How does the scientific research weigh in on stretching?  Should I stretch before or after activity?  There are more questions and grey areas regarding stretching than there are answers.  Over the course of the next few weeks we will cover all of these topics and more in our quest to answer some of the above questions for you.', 'If done properly, stretching can prevent injury, relax the muscles, increase range of motion and flexibility, and better ones performance, especially athletes. Stretching increases blood flow which prevents hardening of the arteries and it also produces synovial fluid, which lubricates the joints that are surrounded by the muscles; which in turn helps prevent arthritis[citation needed]. Stretching stabilizes the bodys natural balance and posture, and aligns the joints leading to better coordination. After any physical activity, there is a buildup of lactic acid in ones body and by stretching the lactic acid is removed, therefore alleviating any muscle pain or cramps. It is important for a person to perform each of the four types of stretching properly to gain the benefits.[unreliable medical source?] It has been shown for example that intensive stretching has a synergistic effect with Plyometric training by protecting the joint and making it more receptive to the benefits of the plyometric drills. Additionally, stretching may actually aid in the growth of muscle tissue (muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia), in a process similar to that of tissue expansion.', 'Anyone'),

It was developed by Lindsay and Moira Merrithew, with the collaboration of physical therapists, and sports medicine and fitness professionals. The most significant difference between Stott Pilates and Joseph Pilates''s original method of the early 1900s is that, where the original method uses a straight spine during exercise, Stott Pilates focuses on maintaining the natural curvature of the spine.Stott Pilates exercises can be done on the floor using a mat or on specialized equipment. Merrithew Health & Fitness manufactures equipment used for Stott Pilates exercises. The main piece of equipment used in the Stott Pilates method is the Reformer, which was designed by Lindsay, a horizontal carriage that glides forward and backward on rollers. Resistance is provided using springs, along with other attachments for a variety of exercises and positions (i.e., lying down, seated, and standing).

Joseph Pilates, the founder of the Pilates Method (which he originally called Contrology), developed mat exercises that were quite similar to the work done on Pilates machines (the Reformer, the Cadillac, the Chair & the Barrel). The idea behind this was to challenge your muscles in a variety of ways. The original Pilates workout included work on several pieces of apparatus - an isolated Pilates Mat work is a relatively new concept in the life of the method.', 'The benefit of Pilates matwork is that it can be done anywhere and with just a mat. It is easy to teach in a group environment, making it more affordable.

All Bikram Yoga classes run for 90 minutes and consist of the same series of 26 postures, including two breathing exercises. Bikram Yoga is ideally practiced in a room heated to 40 °C (104 °F) with a humidity of 40%. All official Bikram classes are taught by Bikram-certified teachers, who have completed nine weeks of training endorsed by Choudhury. Bikram-certified teachers are taught a standardized dialogue to run the class, but are encouraged to develop their teaching skills the longer they teach. This results in varying deliveries and distinct teaching styles.', 'According to the 66-year-old Indian-born yoga guru, the precise sequence of 26 postures and two breathing exercises must be performed within 90 minutes in a heated (100-degrees-plus) room to allow the body to stretch, detoxify, relieve stress, tone, and heal chronic pain such as arthritis, joint aches, knee injuries, back problems, and more.', 'Advanced', 'Mon 08:00-09:00 <br/> Wed 08:00-09:00', 14, 18),

The rig consists of support chains, a webbing strap, a silk hammock and carabiners.\r\nTwo support chains hang down from the ceiling to less than one meter from the floor, and the hammock is connected at the height preferred by the user normally between waist and shoulder.\r\nThe hammock acts like a swing or soft trapeze, supporting the hips for forward bends and back bends. Yoga postures which some find difficult to do on the ground, such as the reverse post, may be easier in mid-air using the hammock, and the hammock moves add variety to a workout', 'Apart from being a major stress-buster due to its high fun quotient, there are some serious health benefits associated with AntiGravity Yoga. “Anyone that has back issues should be doing this class,” says Bill Davis, director of group fitness for The Athletic Club in Brantford, Ont. “It’s better than an inversion table. It gives you the chance to hang freely, allowing your spine to lengthen. People who have taken the class here always comment on how much better their back feels afterward.” Instructor Katlynn MacDonald can attest to this. After suffering from sciatica for years, she has found that practicing AntiGravity Yoga helps to relieve her pain.\r\nIn addition to decompressing the spine, AntiGravity Yoga can help to increase strength and flexibility, as well as bring you greater awareness of your body.', 'Advanced', 'Mon 08:00-09:00 <br/> Wed 08:00-09:00', 14, 18),

You can create a circuit to meet almost any exercise goal. A circuit training workout helps you expedite your workout and builds endurance because it leaves no time for rest between exercises. While a circuit might include any one of hundreds of exercises, the workouts fall into several specific categories. This form of circuit training is similar to a standard weights session in that each exercise is completed before moving on to the next. This means that the relevant muscle groups are worked intensively in a short period of time, rather than at intervals separated by other exercises', 'Circuit training is a type of interval training. Interval training is a great way to increase the body''s ability to burn calories when it is at rest. The exerciser''s heart rate goes up very high, returns to a lower, but still elevated, state, and then goes up very high again. At no point during circuit training does the heart rate return to its resting rate. Circuit training, and interval training overall, increases the amount of oxygen that a person consumes post exercise, and therefore, increases the number of calories that a person burns throughout the day.  \r\n\r\nIt can be used to achieve an increase in lean body mass and a decrease in weight', 'Beginner', 'Mon 08:00-09:00 <br/> Wed 08:00-09:00', 15, 17),

It is a station to station timed circuit, which means that specific exercises are done for a specified amount of time before the individual moves on to the next station for a different exercise.\r\nTimed Station Circuits is in essence it similar to normal circuits in format. The difference being that it allows people to work together because the exercises are set in terms of the number of seconds an exercise is done for, not the number of repetitions.

As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves lifting weights in three attempts. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three.\r\nIn competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped (typically referred to as ''raw'' lifting or ''classic'' in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting.', 'Powerlifting, a strength sport where you compete in the squat, bench press and deadlift, allows you to build muscle and burn fat.

Strongman is about getting you strong to a degree that you never thought possible. It will work wonders for your functional strength. You can easily argue that a deadlift, squat and the olympic lifts are ‘functional’, and they are, to a point. But when we get into the real world there are no perfectly greased collars, well-chalked 20 kg bar with symmetrical weights added to each side. There are odd-objects and awkward grip placements in the real world. If you have ever moved furniture or taken groceries up a few flights of stairs, you know what I am talking about. And if you have ever needed to lift something in the wilderness…it is all heavy as crap and awkward; making you feel like your time in the gym is useless. So, yes, there are some benefits to strongman training.', 'The average person can benefit due to the functionality of the event type training. The events are mirror movements of everyday life.

Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel, or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges'' scorecards at the end of the contest. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, the fight is considered a draw.', 'Fighters - the guys at the top of the game — have the bodies most of us want, and they develop their physiques through a combination of diet, roadwork and intense, sport-specific interval training. You''ll feel the effects of throwing punches throughout your body.\r\nYour lower-back and ab muscles provide power for your punches by initiating an explosive hip turn, and your arms and shoulders bear most of the brunt of the muscle recruitment required for striking. With a consistent boxing regimen, it''s possible to add significant definition to these muscles—and even mass, depending on your genetic makeup—without touching a barbell or dumbbell.

(4, 'Danielle Israel', '', 'I run- a lot! I have been a distance runner for 15 years, and it’s actually the reason I became interested in Yoga. Running has always helped me get to a quite space where I can find solace and feel strong. However, this began to change about two years ago as my life became more stressful and my mind would focus on timelines, chores, tasks, etc. Yoga has helped me slow down and relax even in the most stressful of situations so I can enjoy my run, and feel a sense of ease and strength in each moment. I hope my students can learn how to find ease and strength during times of stress in their own lives.

(7, 'Jessica Clark', '', 'Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Jessica recently moved to LA in August of 2012 from Tallahassee Florida, where she spent most of her life amidst humidity and Southern hospitality. This is also where Jessica attended and graduated from Florida State University, majoring in Anthropology and Creative Writing. Both majors allowed Jessica to explore her curiosity about humanity and her constant quest for truth and beauty, something that Jessica tries to bring into her own yoga practice, as well as the classes she teaches. Always interested in health and fitness, Jessica has been an athlete since as long as she can remember and really enjoys how yoga has transformed her concept of what a healthy body really is and taught her the importance of the mind-body connection. Jessica truly believes that yoga makes you better at whatever you want to do- whether it’s a particular sport, your job, your family life, or just trying to become happier and more stress free.\r\n\r\nJessica found yoga in college after it was suggested to her to alleviate her intense back pains from scoliosis that she had had since a teenager. It was one of those typical love at first down dog moments- Jessica walked out of class virtually pain free, something she hadn’t experienced it many years, and not only that, but feeling more clear minded and happy than she could ever remember being. Jessica went on to practice several times a week, learning more and more about this amazing practice, until she decided to travel to India to learn more about yoga’s ancient roots and live in an ashram for a brief period of time. Although an amazing travel experience that taught her so much about the philosophical and spiritual origins and principles of yoga, Jessica still came back to the US longing for more information on the actual poses, proper alignment and safety, and how to translate all that she had learned to American society, a society very different than that of ancient India. Jessica continued to travel picking up more information about life, herself, and yoga, living in New York City for a time, until finally urged by her sister to come to LA. Jessica immediately loved LA, the vibrancy and diversity of its people, the beautiful nature and scenery that is all around, and of course the weather. But perhaps most of all, Jessica loves the abundance of yoga studios, teachers, classes, and workshops that can be found in LA. Finally, Jessica most recently decided to get her 200 hour Registered Yoga Teacher certification from Yogaworks, where she studied with the ever-amazing teachers Mia Togo and Alexandria Crow. Jessica is so thankful to have learned all that she did at Yogaworks, as it is widely considered to be one of the top authorities on teaching yoga and adapting it to all types of people, no matter what age, gender, personality, or body shape. Hence Yogawork’s motto, “yoga works for everyone.” When Jessica isn’t doing yoga, she can probably be found doing something outdoors (hiking, surfing, climbing), reading just about anything, or trying out a new restaurant with her friends, and just enjoying life.', 'Yoga works teacher', 'Yogaworks certificate', 0, 'http://hypermediagym.altervista.org/resources/images/instructors/Jessica Clark.png'),
